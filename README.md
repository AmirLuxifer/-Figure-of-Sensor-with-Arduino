# FigureOfSensors
This project is for a gas company that shows the amount of sensors
This application works with Arduino
And the method of using it is very simple
You program the Arduino in such a way that it gives the amount of analog input to the device to the computer and divides it by 20 to make the numbers smaller and more readable.
Then you connect Arduino to your computer and run your application and enter your COM port and the program works easily for you
# SeePast
The same tour that you know shows the chart application
But it still saves in csv
This information that is saved in csv can be seen with the seepast application
A grid program is programmed to retrieve another file when the data reaches 200 MB and names the previous file as the system's present.
Another feature of this program is that you set options within the application and create a log file based on them, which is saved in log_file_warning, and you can see and understand the data whenever you need it.

#And be sure to note that the 2 files Log_File and Log_Warning_File must be next to the folders
